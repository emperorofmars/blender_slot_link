Preserve what Actions and Slots are animating.

Re-apply an Action anytime by pressing `Link`.
Prepare the Scene for animating a new Action by pressing `Prepare`.

No need to re-link the Actions and Slots manually and having to remember where.

Writing an exporter for animations in Blender 4.4+ should become possible and fairly straight forward if this extension is used. I am working on a highly experimental one here: https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf_blender

This allows targeting only objects on purpose, for now.
TODO: allow a select few other types, like collections and scenes.

This brings Blender closer to how the rest of the world works. That way, you can animate the shape-keys of a specific instance of a mesh, instead of the mesh resource itself. While this won't replay 100% correctly in Blender, it will in the game-engine you export this to, if that ever becomes possible.
